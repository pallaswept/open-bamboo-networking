# bambu_extract_d

Extracts the RSA private key (`d`) from Bambu Lab's `libbambu_networking.so`
plugin so that `print.*` MQTT commands can be signed natively, without the
proprietary plugin being present at print time.

## How it works

The tool launches a minimal daemon binary in a sandboxed environment, injects an
LD_PRELOAD shim to defeat the watchdog timer, and redirects the daemon's printer
connection to a local fake TLS MQTT broker. When the daemon's signing thread
fires, the tool captures the RSA CRT intermediate values (`d_p`, `d_q`) via a
hardware breakpoint (DR0), reconstructs the full private key offline, and writes
it as a PKCS#1 PEM file.

No real printer is required. No network traffic leaves the machine. Feel free to
run it in a VM or container, particularly if you're worried about what Bambu's
network plugin might be doing to your computer.

Only Linux is supported for extraction, but using the key works on Windows. This
is one slicer key across all instances of BambuStudio. The key is not
distributed here due to uncertainty about the legality of doing so.

Since this is an adversarial environment, only the extraction method is
documented (the cheat answer at the end), not the full mechanism for
determining it. No need to give Bambu a test case to code against.

## Output files

| File | Contents | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `slicer_key.pem` | PKCS#1 RSA-2048 private key | 0600 |
| `slicer_pubkey.pem` | RSA public key (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) | 0644 |
| `slicer_cert_id.txt` | Certificate ID string for envelope signing | 0644 |

Place `slicer_key.pem` and `slicer_cert_id.txt` at:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/BambuStudio/slicer_key.pem`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\BambuStudio\slicer_key.pem`

Or set `BBL_SLICER_KEY_PEM` / `BBL_SLICER_CERT_ID` environment variables.

## Quick start

```bash
# Build (requires libssl-dev, zlib1g-dev — see Makefile)
make -C tools/bambu_extract_d

# Run (takes ~15s; requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE)
sudo tools/bambu_extract_d/bambu_extract_d --out ~/.config/BambuStudio/slicer_key.pem
```

## Build prerequisites

```bash
apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

The three embed headers (`daemon_embed.h`, `watchdog_defeat_embed.h`,
`slicer_cert_embed.h`) must be generated from pre-compiled binaries before
building `bambu_extract_d`. See comments inside each header for details.

## Security note

`slicer_key.pem` is the slicer's actual RSA-2048 private key — treat it like a
`.p12` certificate. Do not share it, commit it to git, or store it with
world-readable permissions.
